title: MARP for Mathematical Slides in Markdown
---

I recently discovered [MARP](http://marp.app/), which allows the creation of slides from simple markdown. The slides can be exported as HTML, PDF, or Powerpoint once written in markdown. 

I decided to write my slides for my colloquim talk about cutting an onion optimally with MARP to test it out. I am very happy with the results, especially being able to export the slides as html and embedding a YouTube video within the slides.

If you want to check out the code for the slides, please see [my GitHub repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drspoulsen/Onion_Marp/main/Onion_Markdown.md)
