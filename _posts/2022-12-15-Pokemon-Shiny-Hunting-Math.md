title: The Math of Shiny Hunting in Pokemon
---

When I am not teaching or writing about mathematics, one of my hobbies is playing Pokemon games. In particular, I have been playing Pokemon Go for the past six years, and have recently started playing Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 

Pokemon Go has encouraged me to be active and to meet people both in my local community and around the world. I know people from my town that I wouldn't otherwise know from the game. I have traveled to events and met people who I have befriended online. I find the games to be very relaxing, and a way to redirect my thoughts away from work.

That said, I have a tendancy to look for the math in everything (although math is NOT everywhere, as I tell my History of Mathematics students). I have joked with colleagues that I could teach a whole introductory mathematics course on the math of Pokemon. One subject in that course would be probability theory via shiny hunting.

A shiny Pokemon is a differently-colored version of a Pokemon. Although they are purely cosmetic, they are highly sought after trophies, with people dedicating hours, days, even months, trying to find a shiny Pokemon. I will sometimes put on a shiny hunting stream in the background while I grade, and I chuckle everytime a person complains about how many Pokemon they have checked without a shiny Pokemon.
