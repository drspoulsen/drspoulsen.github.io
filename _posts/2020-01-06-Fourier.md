title: Comparing and Contrasting Discrete Time and Continuous Time Fourier Transforms
---

This post is perhaps more for me than it is for all of you, but I hope soe of you out there might find this useful.

# Transform Definition
In continuous time, the Fourier Transform $${\cal F}_{\mathbb{R}}$$ of a function $$f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is given by

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{R}}\{f\}(\omega) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \; dt. $$

In discrete time, the Fourier Transform $${\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}$$ of a function $$f:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is usually given by

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}\{f\}(\omega) := \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t}. $$

The discrete time definition feels and looks correct, since it looks exactly like the continuous time definition, but with the integral replaced by a sum. I would tend to agree, but I study time scales, which seeks to unify the continuous and discrete under one analytic framework. Let's try an alternative definition.

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}\{f\}(\omega) := e^{i \omega} \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} = \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{- i \omega (t-1)}$$
