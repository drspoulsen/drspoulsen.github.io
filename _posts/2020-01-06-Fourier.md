title: Comparing and Contrasting Discrete Time and Continuous Time Fourier Transforms
---

This post is perhaps more for me than it is for all of you, but I hope soe of you out there might find this useful.

# Transform Definition
In continuous time, the Fourier Transform $${\cal F}_{\mathbb{R}}$$ of a function $$f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is given by

$$ {\cal F_{\mathbb{R}}}\{f\}(\xi) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \xi t} \; dt. $$

In discrete time, the Fourier Transform $${\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}$$ of a function $$f:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is usually given by

$$ {\cal F_{\mathbb{R}}}\{f\}(\xi) := \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \xi t}. $$
