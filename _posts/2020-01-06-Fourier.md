title: Comparing, Contrasting, and Unifying the Discrete Time and Continuous Time Fourier Transforms
---

This post is perhaps more for me than it is for all of you, but I hope some of you out there might find this useful.

# Transform Definition
The Continuous Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) $${\cal F}_{\mathbb{R}}$$ of a function $$f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is given by

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{R}}\{f\}(\omega) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \; dt. $$

The Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) $${\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}$$ of a function $$f:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is usually given by

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}\{f\}(\omega) := \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t}. $$

The discrete time definition feels and looks correct, since it looks exactly like the continuous time definition, but with the integral replaced by a sum. I would tend to agree, but I study time scales, which seeks to unify the continuous and discrete under one analytic framework. One issue I have with this definition is that the domain of both transforms is the same: $$\omega$$ can be any real number. In reality, the Continuous Time and Discrete Time Fourier Transforms can both be thought of as being evaluated on the cusp between the unstable region and the stable region of the Laplace Transform and the Z-Transform, respectively. This means the domain of the Continuous Time Fourier Transform is $$\mathbb{R}$$, as we already have, but the domain of the Discrete Time Fourier Transform should really be the unit circle. Let's make this more explicit by defining the Discrete Time Fourier Transform in terms of the variable $$e^{i \omega}$$, which is always on the unit circle.

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}\{f\}(e^{i \omega}) := \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \frac{1}{( e^{i \omega} )^t }. $$

Now, the exponential function in the denominator of the integrand above is looking like the [delta exponential](http://timescalewiki.org/index.php/Delta_exponential) on the integers, but without the shift of plus one. Define the new variable $$\xi = (e^{i \omega} -1)/i$$. This is just the unit circle shifted left by one, then rotated by $$-\pi/2$$ radians. This leads to the new DTFT

$$ {\cal F}_{\mathbb{Z}}\{f\}(\omega) := \sum_{t=-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \frac{1}{(1+i \xi)^{t+1}}.$$
