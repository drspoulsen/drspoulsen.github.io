title: On the Time Scale Circle Plus
---

My colleagues and I have been reexamining some basic time scales operations in order to deeply understand their geometry. Here is an interactive about this.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 70%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
  <iframe src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/1fa336e1-262c-48a1-8908-9a30e0e6c395" 
          style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;" 
          frameborder="0" 
          allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

We'll expand this post later.
