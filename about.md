I am John W. Allender Associate Professor of Ethical Data Science at [Washington College.](https://www.washcoll.edu/academic_departments/math-and-computer-science/index.php) I also work as a [mathematical consultant](http://drspoulsen.github.io/consulting). Both of these jobs allow me to think deeply and to communicate clearly about mathematics and its applications. The [blog](http://drspoulsen.github.io/) is an extension of this work, allowing me a venue to write about the ideas I find most interesting. I believe that practicing and applying mathematics is a joyful exercise, and I hope to inspire mathematical joy through mathematical play.

### About the Logo

The logo is a representation of my initials using mathematical ideas. The letters "d" and "p" are formed using lines and circles, central ideas in geometry. The "r" and "s" are formed from a sine wave, a central idea in differential equations. The "s" is the entirety of the sine wave, while the "r" is half the sine wave (colored in blue). The logo has a rotational symmetry, expressing the importance of symmetry abstract algebra.
