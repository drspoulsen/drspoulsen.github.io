My name is Dylan Poulsen. I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics and the Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at [Washington College.](https://www.washcoll.edu/academic_departments/math-and-computer-science/index.php) I also work as a [mathematical consultant](http://drspoulsen.github.io/consulting). Both of these jobs allow me to think deeply and communicate clearly about mathematics. The [blog]((http://drspoulsen.github.io) is an extension of this work, allowing me a venue to write about the ideas I find most interesting. I believe that practicing mathematics is a joyful exercise, and I hope to inspire mathematical joy through mathematical play.
